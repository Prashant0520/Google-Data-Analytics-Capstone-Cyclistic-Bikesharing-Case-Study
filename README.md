# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Cyclistic-Case-Study
Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)
## Background
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
## Scenario
I am assuming to be a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
### Stakeholders
This report also seeks to identify the important stakeholders that are involved in the overall analysis. This includes:
- cyclistic users,
- director of marketing,
- Cyclistic marketing team
- Cyclistic executive team
### Data Source
I will analyze Cyclistic's historical trip data from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022, available at [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), provided by Motivate International Inc. for public use.
We'll explore customer usage trends, but won't access personally identifiable information due to data-privacy restrictions. Thus, we can't link pass purchases to credit card details or determine casual riders' location or pass history.
